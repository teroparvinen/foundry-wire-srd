# SRD content for WIRE

This module contains content packs compatible with the [Whistler's Item Rolls Extended (WIRE)](https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-wire) module.

Content in these compendiums is based on the DND5E system compendiums, modified to include support for all the various features implemented by WIRE.

WIRE contains an import function for updating a non-WIRE character to adopt the items in these packs as well as for updating characters as new versions of
this module are released. See [using WIRE compatible compendiums](https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-wire/wiki/Using-WIRE-compatible-compendiums) in
the WIRE WIKI.
